# ColorWelly
Sample to explore a [bug][p2] affecting the [Purrticles][p1] interface on iPad **only** using iPadOS versions 16.x and 17.x.

The two `ColorPicker` controls are almost impossible to tap - most of the time they fail to react and don't show the popover control.

## State of re-creating the Purrticles bug
The first version with three rows fails to replicate the bug. All pickers work.
