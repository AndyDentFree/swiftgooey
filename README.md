Public explorations of SwiftUI issues

Projects under here will each have their own readme and a short entry here if they are of interest.

- [CrashVanash](./CrashVanash/README.md) - fixes to a crash from auto-repeating a vanishing control
- [ColorWellly](./ColorWelly/README.md) - Demonstrates a problem using a tap gesture on a Grid that affects iOS 16 & 17. Includes a fix.
- [Docundoable](./Docundoable/README.md) - series of commits exploring various bugs in UndoManager with a SwiftUI Document-based app, with final version using our own stack management to replace UndoManager. Includes macOS edit/redo menu commands to complement the iOS toolbar approach.
- [DiscAGriddable](./DiscAGriddable/README.md) - simple but annoying bug when you put a `Grid` inside a `DisclosureGroup` inside a `ScrollView` where toggling a disclosure control resizes the container, causing ugly effects or moving the disclosure chevron completely offscreen.
